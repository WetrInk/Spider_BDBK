# Spider_BDBK
A training program of SPIDER, for baike.baidu.com.

This is my first spider, kinda exciting..wwwww

Lesson by CrazyAnt@www.imooc.com, (https://www.imooc.com/learn/563).
And this program is inspired by TheoKm@GitHub, (https://github.com/TheoKm/Baike_Spider)

As the BD site improved their pages, I've modified CrazyAnt's example program:
1. Update the link(https://baike.baidu.com/item/Python/407313) and the regular exp. //https seems that have no impacts.
2. Add \<h2\> tag, making the title more complete.

But still sometimes this spider will take a break that you should press sth. to continue the process.
And the ASCII problem didn't get fully solved.
